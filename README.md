## Construct? That's proprietary!
I'm well aware. This game will eventually be ported to __Godot__. I'm making a demo in Construct3 for now.

## Can I download the game here?
You most certainly can. I would rather however you get the game on itch.io so that I can get some money for it too. Demo's always free though.
