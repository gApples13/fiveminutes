## Notes for Modders
Code for this game is free and open source under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License](LICENSE.md). You are free to make mods of this game as you wish as long as you also use GNU AGPL. All art assets are protected under copyright and may __not__ be used outside the terms of AGPL.

## What's happening to the project right now? 
currently, I'm taking a short break from development. life has been stressful lately. once I'm done meditating in India or however I spend this hiatus, I'll get to work porting this game to Godot. I plan to have the next demo ready by the end of March. this also means art assets will be removed from the repo soon. I'm doing this as a form of drm. code will be open source, assets will be copyright protected. doom was the same way after all. I don't think this violates gpl. that's all I have to say for now. see you. 

## Can I download the game here?
You may download demos here. Full releases are only available on my Itch.io.
